#String Construction Algorithm

This repository contains C++ code for a string construction algorithm. The algorithm calculates the minimum cost to construct a target string by either appending characters or cloning substrings. The code includes a test program with sample test cases.

Files
1. stringConstruction.h: Header file containing the function declaration.
2. stringConstruction.cpp: Implementation of the string construction algorithm.
3. TestStringCons.CPP: Test program with sample test cases.
4. testStringCons: Executable file generated from the code.

How to Use:

Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
Run the compiled executable (./testStringCons).
